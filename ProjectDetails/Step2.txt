SetUp Frontend
-> Install Vite -> Use React -> Select Javascript
-> Set up Tailwind Css for styling

Vite -> Vite is a super-fast frontend build tool that replaces older tools like Webpack and CRA (Create React App).
It is mainly used with React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS, etc.

1. Super Fast Startup -> Vite runs instantly — no slow bundling.
2. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) -> Changes in your code update in the browser almost instantly.
3. Very lightweight and simple -> No heavy configs.
4. Works with modern JavaScript features

Set up React Dependencies
react-dom -> Handles rendering React components to the browser’s
             DOM.
react-router-dom -> Enables navigation and routing between pages
                     in a React app.
react-icons -> Provides a collection of popular icon libraries
                as React components.
react-toastify-> Shows customizable toast notifications in React
                 apps.
react-spinners -> Offers loading spinner components for React.
axios -> A promise-based HTTP client used to send API requests.
react-redux -> Connects Redux state management with
                 React components.
@reduxjs/toolkit -> A simplified, modern, and optimized way to
                     use Redux with built-in tools.

We setup Browser router for sending the request to the routes

Create pages folder inside src folder.
-> Signup.jsx
-> Login.jsx

Create routes for these in App.jsx and set ToastContainer for sending the popup of success and failure of the activites done by the user.
Set serverUrl also.

SetUp Redux create seperate folder redux inside src folder

Why we use Redux ?
We use Redux to manage state in a predictable, organized, and scalable way—especially in large React applications.
✅ 1. To Manage Global State
Some data needs to be accessed by many components.
Without Redux → we pass props everywhere (prop drilling).
With Redux → any component can get data directly.
Any component → directly reads data from the store. 

Set us redux store using configure store
Creating userSlice for further use.
